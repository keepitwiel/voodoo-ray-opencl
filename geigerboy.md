# Geigerboy

A simple game where the player (Geigerboy) has to get through a map without exposing himself to too much radiation(?). Unfortunately it is pitch black and the only equipment available to him are sonar, radar and a geiger counter.

Alternative: the player can shoot radioactive material, which makes the environment radioactive. By measuring the resulting radioactivity he can "see" a 3D environment.
